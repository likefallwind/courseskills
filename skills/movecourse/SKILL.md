# Movecourse

## Overview

Move or publish generated lesson videos from a course-generation workspace into the aistudy101 website assets tree. Validate the requested course id against `course-sources.yaml`, map `lessonN/*.mp4` to the matching website lesson folder, and use English filenames.

Default behavior is a safe publish copy. Delete the generated originals only when the user explicitly asks for a true move.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- The user says to move, publish, upload, install, or sync AI-generated course videos to aistudy101.
- The current directory looks like `.../course-outline/.../<course>/lesson1`, `lesson2`, etc.
- Each lesson directory contains one generated `.mp4` that should land under `/home/likefallwind/code/aistudy101-website/static/course-assets/<course-id>/lessonN/video/`.

Do not use this skill for slide rendering, narration generation, or video assembly. Use `codex2course` or `pdf2video` first.

## Required Inputs

| Input | Default / source |
|---|---|
| Source course directory | Current working directory, unless user gives a path |
| Course id | Ask the user if not provided; examples: `ai-enlightenment`, `python-intro` |
| Destination root | `/home/likefallwind/code/aistudy101-website/static/course-assets` |
| Course registry | `/home/likefallwind/code/aistudy101-website/course-sources.yaml` |
| Website repo root | `/home/likefallwind/code/aistudy101-website` |
| Optional local asset config | `/home/likefallwind/code/aistudy101-website/course-assets.local.yaml` |

If the course id is not listed in `course-sources.yaml`, distinguish these cases:

- If the user only gave a Chinese title or curriculum placement, inspect the source directory name, `README.md`, git remote, and `ai-study-101-curriculum-system-v0.3.md`. Choose a conservative ASCII id only when it is obvious, such as `python-advanced` for `01-python-advanced`; otherwise ask.
- If the user expects this to become a real website course, register it in `course-sources.yaml` before copying videos. Prefer the source repo remote URL when available, and include fallback metadata matching the curriculum placement.
- If the source videos live only on this machine, add or update `course-assets.local.yaml` so `npm run sync` can republish them from the local source directory.
- Use `--allow-unknown-course` only when the user explicitly wants raw static assets without registering the course.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the source directory for direct child folders named `lessonN`.
2. In each lesson folder, require exactly one direct `.mp4`; report missing or duplicate videos before copying anything.
3. Validate the course id against `course-sources.yaml`.
4. Create missing destination folders: `<dest-root>/<course-id>/lessonN/video/`.
5. Write English filenames. Default to the existing website convention: `lessonN-intro.mp4`.
6. Dry-run first, then execute the copy or true move.
7. Verify every destination file exists and has a non-zero size. Print a source-to-destination manifest.
8. From the website repo, run `npm run sync` so `src/data/course-content.json`, `src/data/courses.json`, and `src/data/curriculum-map.json` reference the published videos.
9. Run `npm run build` when the change should be ready for review or deployment.

## New Course Registration

When the user says a source course "corresponds to" a curriculum item, treat the task as both course registration and video publishing.

1. Check whether the curriculum item already exists as a clickable course in `src/data/curriculum-map.json`.
2. If it is still a non-clickable placeholder, add a `course-sources.yaml` entry with:
   - `id`: stable lowercase ASCII slug, usually derived from the source folder or repo name.
   - `type: gitee`
   - `repo`: the source repo URL from `git -C <source> remote -v` when present.
   - `fallback`: title, stage, education phase, track, status, hours, and theme lines.
3. If the source repo cannot be cloned due to Gitee credentials, keep the registry entry and rely on `course-assets.local.yaml` for the local source fallback.
4. After `npm run sync`, confirm the course appears in:
   - `src/data/courses.json`
   - `src/data/course-content.json`
   - `src/data/curriculum-map.json`

For local-only videos, add:

```yaml
courses:
  python-advanced:
    source_dir: /home/likefallwind/code/course-outline/stage3/01-python-advanced
    video_globs:
      - "lesson*/*.mp4"
    video_publish_name: "{lesson_id}-intro{suffix}"
```

`course-assets.local.yaml` is git-ignored; mention it in the final status, but do not expect it to show up in `git diff`.

## Helper Script

Prefer the bundled script because it preflights all lessons before writing:

```bash
python ~/.agents/skills/movecourse/scripts/movecourse.py --course ai-enlightenment --dry-run
python ~/.agents/skills/movecourse/scripts/movecourse.py --course ai-enlightenment
```

Useful options:

| Option | Use |
|---|---|
| `--source PATH` | Source course directory; defaults to `pwd` |
| `--course ID` | Required course id under `course-assets` |
| `--dry-run` | Print planned operations without writing |
| `--overwrite` | Replace existing destination mp4 files |
| `--move` | Delete source mp4 after verified copy; use only when user explicitly asked |
| `--allow-unknown-course` | Continue when course id is absent from `course-sources.yaml` |
| `--filename-template '{lesson}-intro.mp4'` | English output pattern |

After copying, verify the website data:

```bash
npm run sync
rg -n "python-advanced|Python 编程进阶" src/data/courses.json src/data/course-content.json src/data/curriculum-map.json
npm run build
```

If `npm run sync` reports a Gitee clone/auth failure but then says it used `course-assets.local.yaml`, that is acceptable for local publishing. The final sync summary should have `error: 0`.

## Manual Fallback

If the script is unavailable, validate course id and mp4 counts first, then:

```bash
COURSE_ID="ai-enlightenment"
SRC="$PWD"
DST="/home/likefallwind/code/aistudy101-website/static/course-assets/$COURSE_ID"

for lesson_dir in "$SRC"/lesson*; do
  lesson="$(basename "$lesson_dir")"
  video_dir="$DST/$lesson/video"
  mkdir -p "$video_dir"
  cp -p "$lesson_dir"/*.mp4 "$video_dir/$lesson-intro.mp4"
done
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Using the Chinese source filename in the website tree.** Rename to English; default `lessonN-intro.mp4` is acceptable and matches existing courses.
- **Skipping course-id validation.** `ai-enlightenment` is a course id; the Chinese title `AI 启蒙体验` is not the destination folder name.
- **Publishing videos without registering a new course.** Static files can exist while the course map remains non-clickable. Add `course-sources.yaml` and run `npm run sync`.
- **Forgetting the local asset config.** Direct copies work once, but future syncs need `course-assets.local.yaml` to know where local videos come from.
- **Treating Gitee clone failures as fatal when a local source exists.** If sync falls back to `course-assets.local.yaml` and ends with `error: 0`, report the warning but continue verification.
- **Copying after the first valid lesson without preflight.** Validate every lesson first to avoid a half-published course.
- **Overwriting existing videos silently.** Use dry-run and require `--overwrite` when destination files already exist.
- **Deleting generated originals by default.** Treat "move to server position" as a publish copy unless the user explicitly asks to remove the source files.
